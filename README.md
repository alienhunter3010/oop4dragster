# OOP4Dragster
A basic (and boring) dragster game to learn OOP from scratch

## A CLI game in three classes
Target: learning OOP for people that has no programmer experinces

## OOP concepts you can find

* Structured code / OOP code
* Some simple classes rappresentation
* Extending classes (todo)
* Static properties (todo)
* Fluent syntax
* Dependencies injection (you can avoid this from a basic lesson)
* Single Responsability (recommended, but you can avoid this)

### Omitted

To keep this example project _quick and easy_ to learn we omitted some steps on a just init project.

* Any third-part dependency
* Any Virtul Environment logic

## Coding during lesson
Add a FastForward option on the Race class (the game will be less boring!).

## Play

```bash
python dragster.py
python dragster.py 10000     # Solar Wind wins :D
python dragster.py 10000 4x  # using ffwd option (to be written!)
```

## If you don't like to code during the lesson (todo)

**extending class**, **static properties** and **ffwd option** will be isolated into dedicated git branch.
